# Facial-Keypoint-Detection

In that project, I combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. It was designed to take in any image with faces and predict the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Facial keypoints, encompassing points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face, were integral for numerous applications. These applications included facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The completed code was capable of examining any image, detecting faces, and predicting the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Several examples of these keypoints were illustrated below.
